        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>Johannes Climacus is a pseudonym used by the Danish philosopher SÃ¸ren Kierkegaard in several of his works. He might thus be deemed the author of Kierkegaard's greatest philosophical works. The style of Climacus varies from each of the three productions, but they are singular as to their dialectical mission. Kierkegaard took this name from a Greek monk (c. 570-649) who was the abbot of Saint Catherine's of Alexandria on Mt. Sinai.</p>

            <img src = "">
            <p>Johannes claims not to be a Christian, since he has not yet reached that knowledge of God. The rigorous ascent to God toward impassibility has been replaced by the very passionate and subjective approach to truth whereby the believer, by virtue of the absurd, finds himself before Christ.</p>

            <h2>Afsluttende uvidenskabelig Efterskrift til de philosophiske Smuler</h2>
            <img src = "">  
            <p>The work is an attack against Hegelianism, the philosophy of Hegel, and particularly Hegel's Science of Logic. The work is also famous for its dictum, "subjectivity is truth". </p>

            <h2>De omnibus dubitandum est</h2>

            <p>The book portrays the existential consequences of assuming Cartesian doubt, the method of modern philosophy, to its last consequences. The themes portrayed by this book are followed in the subsequent books written by Kierkegaard under the name of Climacus: Philosophical Fragments and its Concluding Unscientific Postscript.</p>
